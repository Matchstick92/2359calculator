# 2359 Calculator Project
### Project specifications
##### Requirements
- [x] Use the latest expo to create the project
- [ ] Use Redux
- [x] `src` should only contain the following files. `constants.js, actions.js, reducer.js, Button.js, Screen.js, styles.js`
- [x] Write styles.js without width / height key
- [x] Write Button.js as React.memo without equal function and make sure itâ€™s not re-rendering
- [ ] Pass given test case `1 + 2 - 3 * 4 = -9`

##### Bonus points
- [ ] Each file is less than 60 lines
- [ ] Use regex
- [ ] More than 80% test coverage

### My approach
- Observe that it's a scientific calculator with arithmetic rules
- Note that there's no requirement to show statement before evaluation, but show it anyway.
- Due to size of the feature, not much to do. To demonstrate my understanding of Gitflow workflow, the feature is broken down by individual tasks. Beginning from UI, then tackle business logic.
