#2359 Calculator Project
### Project specifications
##### Requirements
- [ ] Use the latest expo to create the project
- [ ] Use redux
- [ ] `src` should only contain the following files. `constants.js, actions.js, reducer.js, Button.js, Screen.js, styles.js`
- [x] Write styles.js without width / height key
- [ ] Write Button.js as React.memo without equal function and make sure itâ€™s not rerender
- [ ] Pass given test case `1 + 2 - 3 * 4 = -9`

##### Bonus points
- [ ] Each file is less than 60 lines
- [ ] Use regex
- [ ] More than 80% test coverage

###My approach
- Observe that it's a scientific calculator with arithmetic rules
- Note that there's no requirement to show statement before evaluation, but show it anyway.
- Begin from UI, then tackle business logic.
